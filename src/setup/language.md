# Language Customisation
Tickets is highly accessible, supporting over 15 languages at the time of writing.

Use the `/language` command with a 2 digit country code to switch your server's language (e.g. `/language de`). If you enter an invalid country code, a list of languages, along with their translation progress will be presented:

![Language list](/img/languages.webp)

If you do not have a language selected, your server's preferred language will be used:

![Community language](/img/server_language.webp)

## Help Wanted
If you are multilingual and interested in helping to translate the bot into more languages, please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/bh6aAfP) and let us know!

## Limitations

- The bot does not currently support server-level customisation of individual messages
- Some messages, such as embed titles and some button messages are not currently translated
